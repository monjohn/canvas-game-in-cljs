This project is a port of James Long's game, [Making Sprite-based Games with Canvas](http://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas), into ClojureScript. You can read all about it [on my blog](http://monjohn.github.io/port-js-canvas-game-to-cljs/). 

If you want to play the final result [here](https://github.com/monjohn/canvas-game-in-cljs/blob/master/resources/index.html).
